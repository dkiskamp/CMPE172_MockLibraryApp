to connect react and node, we are using cors on node side and axios on react side
axios = npm install axios --save in react folder
cors = npm install cors --save in node folder

origin is set to all. and the destination in react is set to localhost:3001/<function name> so you might have to change that stuff based on github or somn

Setting up mapping in react after this.
